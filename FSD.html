    <p>The <strong>cat</strong> is a domestic species of small carnivorous mammal. It is the only domesticated species
        in the family Felidae and is commonly referred to as the domestic cat or house cat to distinguish it from the
        wild members of the family

    <p>The <b>cat <i>(Felis catus)</i></b> is a domestic species of small carnivorous mammal.It is the only domesticated
        species in the family Felidae and is commonly referred to as the domestic cat or house cat to distinguish it
        from the wild members of the family. A cat can either be a house cat, a farm cat, or a feral cat; the latter
        ranges freely and avoids human contact. Domestic cats are valued by humans for companionship and their ability
        to kill rodents. About 60 cat breeds are recognized by various cat registries</p>

    <h2>Evolution</h2>
    <p>The domestic cat is a member of the <em>Felidae</em>, a family that had a common ancestor about 10–15 million
        years ago.<sub>[42]</sub> The genus Felis diverged from other Felidae around 6–7 million years ago.[43] Results
        of phylogenetic research confirm that the wild Felis species evolved through sympatric or parapatric speciation,
        whereas the domestic cat evolved through artificial selection.[44] The domesticated cat and its closest wild
        ancestor are diploid and both possess 38 chromosomes<sub>[45]</sub> and roughly 20,000 genes.<sub>[46]</sub> The
        leopard cat (Prionailurus bengalensis) was tamed independently in China around 5500 BC. This line of partially
        domesticated cats leaves no trace in the domestic cat populations of today.</p>
    <h2>Size</h2>
    <p>The domestic cat has a smaller skull and shorter bones than the European wildcat.<sub>[60]</sub> It averages
        about <ins>46 cm (18 in) in head-to-body length and 23–25 cm (9–10 in) in height, with about 30 cm (12 in) long
            tails.</ins> Males are larger than females.<sub>[61]</sub> Adult domestic cats typically weigh between 4 and
        5 kg (9 and 11 lb).</p>
